## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `taskmasterpro.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/releases/tag/v1.4).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your TaskMasterPro.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and run the command `java -jar taskmasterpro.jar` to start the application. A GUI similar to the image below should appear in a few seconds. <br>

1. Type your commands in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * `list` : Lists all employees.

    * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds an employee named `John Doe` to TaskMasterPro.

    * `delete 3` : Deletes the employee with employee ID = 3.

    * `task meeting` : Creates a task with description called meeting.

    * `clear` : Deletes all stored data.

    * `exit` : Exits the app.
<br>
1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

* Any command that requires `EMPLOYEE_ID` or `TASK_ID` as a parameter does not refer to the nominal number in the list but rather specifically the id as indicated below:

### Saving the data

TaskMasterPro data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data.

Note that saves are only made after running a command, not on app startup!
</div>

### Editing the data file

TaskMasterPro data are saved automatically as a JSON file [JAR file location]/data/taskmasterpro.json . Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, TaskMasterPro will discard all data and start with the original sample data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause TaskMasterPro to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous TaskMasterPro home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known Issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **For advanced users who choose to manually change the JSON file**, you could change the employee and task id to negative. This could potentially reset the system but there is also a chance that the system will load with the indicated negative ids, the application will function as normal with the negative id. This will be addressed in a future iteration.
